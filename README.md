# WordleApp

## Overview

My goal for this project was to learn **Swift** and **SwiftUI** while building a fun Wordle-style game that I could play on my phone without dealing with ads.

This app is essentially a clone of *The New York Times* Wordle game. When you launch the app, it immediately starts a new game and generates a random five-letter word for you to guess. You have up to six attempts to guess the word, and the game provides feedback after each guess:
- ðŸŸ© **Green** letters are in the correct position
- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** letters are in the word but in the wrong position
- â¬œ **Gray** letters are not in the word

The ultimate goal is to expand this project into a more complete game that includes multiple rounds, a leaderboard, and daily word challenges.

My main purpose in building this project was to gain experience with **mobile app development** and become more comfortable using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, which Iâ€™m interested in pursuing further.

## Future Work

Here are some planned improvements and features Iâ€™d like to add:
- Validate that the guessed word exists in the dictionary (not just random letters)
- Add a **Word of the Day** mode and main menu
- Implement player **statistics and streak tracking**
- Add animations and visual polish for a smoother user experience
- Create a leaderboard for multiple players
